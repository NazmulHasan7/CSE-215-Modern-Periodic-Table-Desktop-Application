History of the periodic table of chemical elements ::
-----------------------------------------------------

In 1809 : 
At least 47 elements were discovered, and scientists began to see patterns in the characteristics.

In 1863 :
English chemist John Newlands divided the then discovered 56 elements into 11 groups,
based on characteristics.

In 1869 :
Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev started the development of the periodic table, 
arranging chemical elements by atomic mass. He predicted the discovery of other elements, 
and left spaces open in his periodic table for them.

In 1894 :
Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh discovered the noble gases, 
which were added to the periodic table as group 0.

In 1897 :
English physicist J. J. Thomson first discovered electrons; small negatively charged particles in an atom.

In 1900 :
Bequerel discovered that electrons and beta particles as identified by the Curies are the same thing.

In 1903 :
Rutherford announced that radioactivity is caused by the breakdown of atoms.

In 1911 :
Rutherford and German physicist Hans Geiger discovered that electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom.

In 1913 :
Bohr discovered that electrons move around a nucleus in discrete energy called orbitals.

In 1914 :
Rutherford first identified protons in the atomic nucleus. 

In 1932 :
James Chadwick first discovered neutrons, and isotopes were identified. 
This was the complete basis for the periodic table. 

In 1945 :
Glenn Seaborg identified lanthanides and actinides (atomic number >92), which are usually placed below the periodic table
